# Email_Application_REST-API
Gmail is a free email service provided by Google. As of 2019, it had 1.5 billion active users worldwide. Users can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size, including attachments, while they can send emails up to 25 megabytes

We worked on creating REST API and writing business logic for an GMail application. Our project performs fundamental operations of an email application, where our user's data is validated, mapped, processed with business logic & persisted in the database.
